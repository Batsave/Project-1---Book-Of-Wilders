### üí° Concept Design :
We wanted to create an innovative and stylish website. the objective was to simplify navigation on mobile and PC by giving the user the choice of how they wish to view the profiles.

We therefore offer the display of profiles in the form of cards and the user can choose to see them in the form of a carousel or a list.

He can also choose to search for a profile based on keywords.

We also wanted to provide an option to switch from the basic dark theme to a light theme
